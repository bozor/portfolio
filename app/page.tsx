          I have been able to work on a wide array of different projects in varied environments which have helped me to broaden my skill
          set. I am just as comfortable prototyping ideas in Figma as I am turning them into web and mobile apps in Visual Studio Code. I
          always look to challenge myself and to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies in order to integrate them into my
          solutions.
